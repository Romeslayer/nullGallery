# Challenges and Wins
- The biggest win with this project was creating a fetch call that would generate the link for a different fetch call because the Chicago Institute of Art delivers their images from a different API that needs to be generated from the first call. This made it difficult to test properly because the first response would dictate what the second request should look like.

# Future Additions
- User can change search query
- User can select different pages of results
- User can modify images by writing graffiti on them.
